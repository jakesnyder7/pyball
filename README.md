# Fantasy Player Portal

Welcome to Fantasy Player Portal! This is an app designed for fantasy football players to help make data-driven decisions for building your fantasy team and choosing which players to play each week.

The app is in `prototype`. `prototype/pyball` contains the frontend React app and `prototype/backend` contains the Django backend and API.

## Run the App

To run the app, you will need to run two servers. In one terminal window, navigate to `pyball/prototype/backend` and run `python manage.py makemigrations`. Then run `python manage.py runserver` to start the backend server. In another terminal window, navigate to `pyball/prototype/pyball` and run `npm start`. You may need to install a few packages. This will run the frontend server.

Now the app is ready to use!
